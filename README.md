# SpaceInvaders
Space Invaders game was developed for Unreal programming challenge.

Tool used: Unreal Engine version 5.0.3 with Visual Studio 2019. Blender was used for making the models.
Extra tool that I used was the SpawnerTool that I use in other projects as well.

The code, models, effects and sounds were all made by me, Asko Suvanto.
