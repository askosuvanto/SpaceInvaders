# SpaceInvaders
Space Invaders game was developed for Unreal programming challenge at Games Job Fair Spring 2023.

Tool used: Unreal Engine version 5.0.3 with Visual Studio 2019. Blender was used for making the models.
Extra tool that I used was the SpawnerTool that I use in other projects as well.
